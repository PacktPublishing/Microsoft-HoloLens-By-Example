## Chapter 1 
Enchanted Reality, Introduction to the concepts of Mixed Reality, contrasting it against Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) including a discussion around the opportunities it offers in creating more natural and immersive experiences..

## Chapter 2 
Tagging the world using DirectX, This chapter begins walking through setting up the environment then walking the user through building an augmented reality application that leverages Microsoft Cognitive Services Computer Vision API to tag recognised content within the users field of view, specifically recognizing faces.
Chapter 3, Assistant item finder using DirectX, In this chapter we build on top of the previous example by allowing the user to pin tagged items and have the system assist you navigate back to them.

## Chapter 4 
Building Paper Trash Ball in Unity, This chapter walks the reader through the development of a popular Smartphone game Paper Toss, but unlike the traditional game, the setting will be the userâ€™s physical environment.

## Chapter 5 
Building Paper Trash Ball in Unity using HoloToolkit, This chapter is a continuation of the previous but looks at re-implementing the project using HoloToolkit, collection of scripts and components intended to accelerate development of Hololens application development, and extends it by adding an holographic user interface.

## Chapter 6 
Interacting with Holograms using Unity, In this chapter we explore various ways the user can interact with holograms. We start by discussing gestures, along with allowing the user to **touch** holograms, then introduce the reader to Voice User Interfaces, walking the reader through extending the application to allow the user to manipulate the hologram using their voice.

## Chapter 7 
Collaboration with Hololens using Unity, In this chapter we walk through building a project where the hololens is shared across multiple devices. The example is based on a collaborative design review where-by a design (3D model) is streamed to multiple Hololens devices where it is projected into the real-world allowing for richer engagement and collaboration.

## Chapter 8 
Developing a multiplayer game using Unity, Our final example is building a fun multiplayer game, inspired by the classic Cannon Fodder, where the user will navigate their team around the environment to eliminate their opponent.
